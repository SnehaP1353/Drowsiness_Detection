TITLE :-Real time application for "Drowsiness Detection".


I developed a  "Drowsiness Detector"  an innovative project in Python, leveraging the power of machine learning and Python libraries. Through the integration of cutting-edge image processing techniques, the system adeptly discerns the state of a person's eyes, classifying them as either open or closed. Harnessing the capabilities of machine learning libraries, this project ensures accurate and real-time eye state detection.
